Hey there!  
I'm a 20 years old french guy, currently studying and working for [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/en/), a french engineering school specialised in computer science. I discovered programming at the age of 8, and I have never stopped ever since. I have come accross many languages, but I have a preference for C, C++ and low-level programming. I also like to play with hardware and have a special interest in embedded systems.  
I am currently on my 3rd year of studies, and working on making a shell and a compiler (in C) for a custom language. I am also working on a few side projects, [more on that](/projects).   
I guess it's obvious by now but I'm a tech nerd and play my fair share of video games. I am also a roller coaster enthusiast and used to do parkour, though I'm trying to get back at it.
