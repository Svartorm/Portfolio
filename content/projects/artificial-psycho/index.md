## Description
Artificial Psycho is a fast-FPS game with a focus on movement and combat. It is a spiritual successor to the Quake series, and is being developed by a small team of 4 people, including myself. 
   
The game is currently on a very early stage of development and as of yet there is no official release. We are working hard to get a playable version out as soon as possible. You, howerver, can download the game in its current state from [here](#download) and try it out for yourself. 

## Project Details
Artificial Psycho is being developed using the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. The game is being developed for PC, and we want it to be released on Steam on we are satisfied with the result.

## Goals
The core gameplay of Artificial Psycho is to get through levels as fast as possible, while killing enemies and avoiding obstacles. The game feature a variety of powerful weapons (more on that [here](#weapons)) and have a focus on speedrunning with the implementation of a global scoreboard[*](#features). You can also play the game with a friend, as it features a multiplayer mode.
The player is able to fully customise the way they play the game thanks to the money system, which allows them to buy new weapons, upgrades and skills. Each level reset your purchases, so you have to come up with a new strategy every time you play a level. This allows for a lot of replayability, as you can try out different strategies and playstyles.
   
*The scoreboard is not maintained anymore as we are currently working on a new version of the game.
