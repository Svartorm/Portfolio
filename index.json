I'm a 20 years old french guy, currently studying and working for EPITA, a french engineering school specialised in computer science. I discovered programming at the age of 8, and I have never stopped ever since. I have come accross many languages, but I have a preference for C, C++ and low-level programming. I also like to play with hardware and have a special interest in embedded systems. I guess it's obvious by now but I'm a tech nerd and play my fair share of video games. I am also a roller coaster enthusiast and used to do parkour, though I'm trying to get back at it.\rSide Projects I am currently on my 3rd year of studies, and working on making a shell and a compiler (in C) for a custom language.
